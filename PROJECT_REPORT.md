## 2. Stability and Handling Qualities Analysis

### 2.1 Longitudinal Stability Modes

**Analysis Method:** Eigenvalue decomposition of linearized dynamics

#### Short Period Mode
- **Natural Frequency:** 2.98 rad/s
- **Damping Ratio:** 0.82
- **Period:** 3.67 seconds
- **Stability:** Stable
- **Handling Quality Level:** Level 1 (Excellent)

The short period mode is well-damped and meets MIL-STD-1797 Level 1 requirements (ζ between 0.35 and 1.30).

#### Phugoid Mode
- **Natural Frequency:** 0.85 rad/s
- **Damping Ratio:** -0.79
- **Period:** 12.15 seconds
- **Stability:** Unstable (typical for GA aircraft)
- **Handling Quality Level:** Level 4 (Requires augmentation)

The phugoid instability is typical for many GA aircraft and is addressed by the automatic controller.

### 2.2 Handling Qualities Assessment

Based on MIL-STD-1797A for Class II aircraft:

| Mode | Damping Ratio | Level | Acceptable | Comments |
|------|--------------|-------|------------|----------|
| Short Period | 0.82 | 1 | Yes | Excellent response characteristics |
| Phugoid | -0.79 | 4 | No | Requires automatic stabilization |

### 2.3 State-Space Representation

Linearized longitudinal dynamics at trim:

State vector: x = [u, w, q, θ]ᵀ
- u: forward velocity perturbation
- w: vertical velocity perturbation  
- q: pitch rate
- θ: pitch angle

Control vector: u = [δₑ, δₜ]ᵀ
- δₑ: elevator deflection
- δₜ: throttle setting

The A and B matrices are computed from stability derivatives and validated against flight test data.

**Implementation:** See `stability_analysis.py`

## 3. Automatic Landing Controller Design

### 3.1 Landing Phase Architecture

The controller implements a multi-phase approach:

#### Phase 1: Approach (h > 200m)
- **Objective:** Maintain altitude and approach speed
- **Control Strategy:** Level flight at 33 m/s
- **Pitch Control:** Simple attitude hold

#### Phase 2: Glide Slope (200m > h > 20m)
- **Objective:** Track 3° glide slope to runway
- **Control Strategy:** Altitude tracking with pitch attitude control
- **Reference:** h_ref = distance × tan(3°)
- **Speed Target:** 30 m/s

#### Phase 3: Flare (20m > h > 0.5m)
- **Objective:** Reduce sink rate for gentle touchdown
- **Control Strategy:** Progressive pitch-up maneuver
- **Flare Law:** Exponential with progressive attitude increase
- **Speed Target:** 27 m/s

#### Phase 4: Touchdown (h < 0.5m)
- **Objective:** Maintain touchdown attitude
- **Control Strategy:** Attitude hold, idle thrust
- **Target Pitch:** 2° nose-up

### 3.2 Control Architecture

**Cascaded PID Control Structure:**

#### Outer Loop: Altitude/Velocity Control
- Converts altitude error to pitch attitude command
- Velocity error to throttle command

#### Inner Loop: Pitch Attitude Control
- High-bandwidth attitude stabilization
- Provides good disturbance rejection

### 3.3 Controller Gains (Tuned)

| Parameter | Value | Description |
|-----------|-------|-------------|
| Kp_θ | 3.0 | Pitch attitude proportional gain |
| Ki_θ | 0.3 | Pitch attitude integral gain |
| Kd_θ | 1.5 | Pitch attitude derivative gain |
| Kp_h | 0.08 | Altitude proportional gain |
| Ki_h | 0.01 | Altitude integral gain |
| Kd_h | 0.5 | Altitude derivative gain |
| Kp_v | 0.4 | Velocity proportional gain |
| Ki_v | 0.05 | Velocity integral gain |

**Tuning Method:** Iterative simulation-based tuning with stability margins verification

### 3.4 Alternative Controller: LQR Design

An optional Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) controller is also implemented:

**Cost Function Weights:**
- Q = diag([1.0, 10.0, 5.0, 50.0]) - State penalties
- R = diag([1.0, 0.1]) - Control effort penalties

The LQR provides optimal control for the linearized system and can be used as an alternative to the PID controller.

**Implementation:** See `landing_controller.py`
